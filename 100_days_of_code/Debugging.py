#Describe the problem - Write your answers as comments:
# 1. What is the for loop doing?
#  The for loop iterates i from 1 to 19 
# 2. When is the function meant to print "You got it"?
# When the i is equal to 20
# 3. What are your assumptions about the value of i? 
# The i iterates only till 19 because range function is set from 1 to 20 which excludes the last number of the range
